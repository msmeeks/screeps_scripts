TO DO
=====

[] distributors won't pick up dropped energy
[] distributors hold energy if there is no need for it. consider returning it to storage, delivering to another room, or collecting
[] distributors suck if there is not an aboundance of energy in containers or storage in the room. consider collecting from another room.
[] enable repairer to repair in other rooms
[] centralize energy supply computation and cache results in room memory
[] prioritize hostiles (healers, ranged attackers, attackers, lowest health) - attackers with support healers are not dying
[] use flags instead of lists in memory to manage position assignments
[] miners are useless when another creep occupies the mining position even if there is another open access point to the source
     either make miner's go to the source rather than a nearby point or make other creeps move out of the way
